Project idea related to the right-hand rule in Python could be to create a program that visualizes the direction of magnetic fields using the right-hand rule.
The program could prompt the user to input the direction of the current, and then use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field. The program could then display the direction of the magnetic field using a 3D vector visualization.
